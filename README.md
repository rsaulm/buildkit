## Overview

BuildKit is a powerful tool that enhances the image-building process. It is designed to work seamlessly with Dockerfiles while providing additional features that improve performance and usability. With BuildKit, developers can build images faster and with less resource consumption.

## Features

- **Concurrent Builds**: BuildKit can run multiple build processes at the same time, significantly speeding up the build cycle.
- **Cache Efficiency**: It uses advanced caching mechanisms to avoid redundant work, saving time and resources.
- **Dockerfile-Agnostic**: While it works well with Dockerfiles, it is not limited to them, allowing for flexibility in how images are built.
- **Cloud-Native Support**: Ideal for modern applications that run in cloud environments.
- **OCI Compatibility**: Fully compliant with the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards.
